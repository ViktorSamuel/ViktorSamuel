# Hey there! 👋

I'm Viktor Samuel Podhradský, a Computer Science student at FMFI UK (Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Informatics, Comenius University). I have a strong passion for math 🧮 and coding 🖥️, constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.

- 💡 My love for learning and creating new technologies drives me forward. I thrive on pushing boundaries and exploring innovative solutions to complex problems. With a keen eye for detail, I believe in the power of clean and efficient code.

- 📚 When I'm not immersed in coding, you can often find me buried in books, diving into various subjects that intrigue me. I'm a firm believer in continuous self-improvement and strive to stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and advancements.

- ⚽️  I'm not just a fan of intellectual pursuits, though! I'm also a sports enthusiast who finds inspiration in teamwork and collaboration. While I enjoy working with others, I'm equally comfortable taking on challenges solo, leveraging my strong problem-solving skills. Always open to collaborating with others to achieve the best outcomes.

Feel free to join me on my journey as I build exciting projects and explore the vast world of computer science. Let's connect 🤝 and create something amazing together! 🚀
